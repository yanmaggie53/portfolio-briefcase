# Various projects from CS 204 Intro to Front-End Development

JellyBlobs was a game that my partner, Caia Soyer, and I created for our class final project.
All the code for that game can be found in the JellyBlobs folder. 

The other files are HTML/CSS/JS pertaining to other projects worked on during that semester.
However, the finished products of those other files are no longer featured on my portfolio, 
so consider them as archive files.
